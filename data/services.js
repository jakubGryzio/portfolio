  "I've been developing desktop applications to create new features in a large desktop application. I work on source code created and maintained for many years. At work, I have been using C#, including .NET Framework 4.7.2 and, among others, Windows Forms. In the past, I developed desktop applications using Python to compute massive datasets or automate processes. I have been creating script applications as well as object-oriented applications, so I have often used Python libraries like PyQt, NumPy, Pandas, and open3d, or I'm creating my own modules.";

  "I really love to create web applications and websites. I started by creating a web app with Flask - Python framework. After that, I've learned a lot about JavaScript, HTML 5, and CSS 3. So now, I am developing web applications using JavaScript and the most beloved library - ReactJS. Soon, I would like to start learning more about TypeScript. I'm familiar with React libraries: Redux, Redux-Toolkit, Reactstrap, or NextJS.";

  "I've started the development of full-stack applications by using Flask - Python framework. After that, I've chosen to build a backend server on Django and also created REST API with Django Rest Framework. So now, I am combining Django on the backend side and React on the frontend side. I am familiar with relative and NoSQL databases, for example: PostgreSQL, Oracle, MongoDB, Redis, and Neo4j.";
